We reached the campsite, They welcomed us with evening snacks and after that we went to beach and enjoyed the beautiful sunset. Later that night trip organise arranged amazing dinner with wide variety of food we were wide awake till 2-3AM listening to music enjoying pleasant voice of waves.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px;">Day 2: We woke up early enjoyed the sunrise with the beach had breakfast and headed for our next detination where we had amazing sports ride. It was very calm and pleasant enviornment. We booked a resort for the next day reached there had our lunch and took a power nap. After that went for the beach watching the sunset.
